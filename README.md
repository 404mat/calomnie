### `MossFrame`

âœ¨ MossFrame is a simple color theme for VSCode, with minimal color syntax and minimal distractions. This was largely inspired by the _poimandres_ theme in earlier versions, and has now evolved into it's own design.

## Recomendations

I recommend using this theme with the [City Lights](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Yummygum.city-lights-icon-vsc) B&W icon pack for the ultimate minimal experience (this is how I personnally use it).

## Contribute

You can add your ideas to the theme or make alternate version if you want, they are all appreciated !

**Enjoy!**
